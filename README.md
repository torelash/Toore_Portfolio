# About me
Hi! My name is Toorese originally from Lagos, Nigeria. I currently work as a BI Engineer at Amazon. This repo is to help showcase my visualization principles and how I have conveyed that in my work.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to show the best way data can be used to convey and express intentions.

This is my portfolio for future viewing
## Assignment 1
This is a visualization showing debt to GDP ratio of various governments all over the world, and my subsequent critique. Click [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/govtdataviz)

## Assignment 2
I used Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf) to critique a visualization from Visual Capital. Consequently, I wireframed a potential solution to the issues I found, tested the solution, and drew up a version of the visualization.

## Final Project 1
Here, I talked about the data I want to use for my final project, storyboarding, and initial sketches. Click [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojectone)

## Final Project 1
My final project lacks the necessary data to build a narrative structure. hence, I decided to do a change of topic. My storyboarding and initial sketches for the new topic can be found [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojectrejig).

## Final Project Part 2
[Here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojecttwo), I talk about my change of topic, user research, and feedback from my audience. In addition, I also briefly describe the next steps I will be taking to collate my work together.

## Final Project Part 3
For my final part, I talked about the details of my topic. I also discussed certain changes made based on user feedback so I can create a good end product. Click [here](https://toorel.github.io/Toorese-Portfolio/finalprojectthree)
